I’m a PhD student in Statistics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway, where I work on methodological developments in scalable Monte Carlo methods.

My supervisor is Håkon Tjelmeland, and I also collaborate with Andrew Holbrook (UCLA) and Nathan Glatt-Holtz (Indiana University Bloomington) on scalable Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian inverse problems.
