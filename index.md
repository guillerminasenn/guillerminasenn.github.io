I'm a PhD student in statistics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway.

My supervisor is Håkon Tjelmeland and I research computationally efficient Monte Carlo methods.

I'm also collaborating with Andrew Holbrook (UCLA) and Nathan Glatt-Holtz (Indiana University Bloomington) on scalable Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian inverse problems.
